The purpose of this project is to learn some Python by building a simple program that parses SEC filings of various companies. Hundreds of 8-k (current report) documents are filed with the SEC every day, but I'm only interested in the ones that contain the topic of "Other Events". Going through all the 8-k's and checking for this topic is time-consuming and involves a lot of clicks, so I built a crawler that finds the right ones, proceeds to their content, and presents them to me on new browser tabs. Technologies used: Python, BeautifulSoup.
